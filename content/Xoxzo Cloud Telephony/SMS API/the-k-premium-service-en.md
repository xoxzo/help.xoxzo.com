## What is the K-Premium Service?

K-Premium is an optional service tailored for JP's mobile operator subscribers.
Due to the restrictions on the operators and frequent MNPs, some JP subscribers cannot
receive messages from alphanumeric sender IDs or some messages can get blocked.
As the messages sent via K-Premium will be directly passed to the JP operators,
better delivery rates are expected. Sender IDs for messages through K-Premium
will be set as below.

You will need to be registered in order to use K-Premium, and your registration
details will be shared with [KDDI Corporation](http://www.kddi.com/english/).
To prevent abuse of the service your registration details might also be shared with
[Softbank Group Corp](https://www.softbank.jp/en/), [NTT Docomo, Inc.](https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/english/)
and [Rakuten Mobile (Japanese only)](https://network.mobile.rakuten.co.jp/)
as the need arises.

Please contact [help@xoxzo.com](mailto:help@xoxzo.com) for more details and registration.
