## What is Plus Message App?

+Message is a messaging app jointly developed by the Japanese Mobile Phone Carriers (Docomo, au, and Softbank) that allows you to text-chat using just your phone number. The ability to send and receive photos, videos, stamps, etc. is a major feature that SMS (Short Message Service) does not have.

App Details can be found in the Carrier websites (in Japanese):　
[NTT Docomo](https://www.docomo.ne.jp/service/plus_message/about/)　/  
[au (KDDI)](https://www.au.com/mobile/service/plus-message/)　/  
[Softbank](https://www.softbank.jp/mobile/service/plus-message/)

Version 3.14.3 will be released for Android smartphones in the spring of 2024.<br>
