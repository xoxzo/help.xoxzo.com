<div id="dkim">
<h3>DKIM</h3>
</div>
<br>
DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is a method that uses electronic signatures to check whether the sender of the email has been spoofed.
By attaching an electronic signature to the email sent by the sender and verifying it when the recipient receives the email, spoofing and falsification of the email can be detected.
<br>
**how to set DKIM security at MailSMS** <br>
Please set one of the following values as the minimum criteria for DKIM judgment to allow SMS sending.
<br>
PASS: Send SMS only for emails that pass DKIM authentication.<br>
GRAY: In addition to PASS, send SMS without DKIM signature.<br>
FAIL: In addition to PASS and GRAY, SMS will also be sent for verification failure.<br>
<br>

<div id="dmarc">
<h3>DMARC</h3>
</div>
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) is used by the sender to declare the recommended action when the receiver fails to authenticate to DNS as a DMARC policy, and to determine whether the receiver is spoofing when the authentication fails.
<br>
**how to set DMARC security at MailSMS**<br>
Please set one of the following values as the minimum criteria for DMARC judgment to allow SMS sending.
<br>
PASS: Send SMS only for emails that pass DMARC authentication.<br>
GRAY: In addition to PASS, also send SMS messages where at least one SPF or DKIM passed authentication, but the sending domain has no DMARC policy or uses the p=none policy.<br>
FAIL: In addition to PASS and GRAY, SMS will also be sent for verification failure.<br>
<br>


<div id="spf">
<h3>SPF</h3>
</div>
SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is a method to check whether the sender of the mail received using the address is spoofed.
Pre-register her IP address of the server used when sending mail as her SPF record in the sender's DNS. When the recipient receives the email, it checks it against the sender's SPF record to determine if it's spoofed.
<br>

**how to set SPF security at MailSMS**<br>
Please set one of the following values as the minimum criteria for SPF judgment to allow SMS sending.
<br>
PASS: Send SMS only for emails that pass SPF authentication.<br>
GRAY: In addition to PASS, send SMS even if the SPF policy does not exist.<br>
FAIL: In addition to PASS and GRAY, SMS will also be sent for verification failure.<br>
