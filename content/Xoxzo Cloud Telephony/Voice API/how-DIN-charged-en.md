### Dial-In-Numbers API
Dial In Numbers (DIN) are local numbers (DID) which you can subscribe and receive calls with. <br>
By setting the parameter with any subscription of a DIN, 
you can either answer an incoming call with your specified .mp3 file, 
original message specified with our TTS,  
transfer the call to the other number as you like or
store messages in the Voicemail.

### Charges for Dial-In-Numbers API
The first 30-day number subscription cost will be deducted from the account balance at the subscription time.<br>
Every webhook call will charge the account for receiving call charges according to the length of the call. The first one-minute charge will be deducted from the account balance at the webhook call.<br>
(Optional actions can be found [here](https://help.xoxzo.com/en/xoxzo-cloud-telephony/voice-api/articles/what-does-din-do/))<br>
The pricing can be confirmed on the [pricing page](https://www.xoxzo.com/en/about/pricing/voice/#din).<br>

### Notes
Account authentication is required for a DIN subscription. <br>
We will contact you for the authentication in case the user does not have a contract with us and the DIN subscription may cancelled due to the authentication failure. <br>
<br>
The user without the user contract (prepay user) must be aware of the account balance to prevent the failure in DIN subscription renewal and webhook call at the call receipt.<br>
