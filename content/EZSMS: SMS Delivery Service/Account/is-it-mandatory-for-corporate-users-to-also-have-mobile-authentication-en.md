The Mobile Number authentication has become mandatory to continue using the service. Without Mobile Number authentication, users will not be able to make online points purchases.

Corporate users have already been verified through different channels and can still use the EZSMS service without interruption even without Mobile Number authentication. However, if you need to purchase points online, please carry out Mobile Number authentication.
