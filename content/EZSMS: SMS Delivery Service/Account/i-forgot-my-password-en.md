Please reset your password in case you forgot it.

In case you forgot your **email address**, or you lost the access to the email address, the password reset will not be available, because this falls into a case of clause 2-3 in our [TOS](https://www.ezsms.biz/en/faq/tos/). You can create another account to use EZSMS too, please retain your registered email address.
